to do:
- plot confusion matrices for prediction probabilities
- heatmap?

- confusion matrices for each polarization state
- f1 score for each polarization state
- accuracy for each polarization state 
- plot of both of the things above?

Week 8
- train a few different models then evaluating the accuracies across all polarization states for each model
- switch around training/testing data splits
- 5 cross fold validation
- export datasets as csv to access across notebooks?
- evaluate scores for a 1 layer LSTM model and compare to manuscript model
- try 60:20:20

KCFV function is written very poorly could go back and cut down on many lines
